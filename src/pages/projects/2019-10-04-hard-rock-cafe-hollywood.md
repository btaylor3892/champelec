The new Hard Rock Cafe in Hollywood, FL is located inside the newly renovated Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. The walls of the restaurant exhibit some of the Hard Rock's vast collection of Rock and Roll memorabilia inside cases which are all individually lit by LED lights. The ceiling and several walls have led light strips installed in them to give this Hard Rock Cafe a unique look. Adjacent to the Hard Rock Cafe is the Rock Shop which features a unique chandelier lighting up all of the Hard Rock Merchandise. 

The fast track schedule for this job demanded detailed coordination with all trades to ensure an on time completion in just 4 months.

**Owner: Seminole Tribe of Florida**

**General Contractor: Suffolk Yates JV**
