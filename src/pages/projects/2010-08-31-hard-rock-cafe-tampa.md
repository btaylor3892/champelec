This Hard Rock Cafe was a prototype for new design for future Hard Rock Cafe's around the world. It is located inside the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Tampa. The Restaraunt features intricate and detailed work everywhere you look. The bar has a canopy which is washed in light and framed in neon lights of Kiss lyrics. The stage is located in the rear of the Cafe and is well set up for the Rock and Roll legends that will grace it with their music. The memorabilia on the walls are a masterpiece of their own in frames and flooded with light both from inside the frame and above.

It was a design build project in collaboration with GSA Consulting Engineers and was a fast track project from the very start. The entire project from demo through completion was finished in six months.

**Owner: Hard Rock International**

**Contractor:** **Manhattan Kraft**
