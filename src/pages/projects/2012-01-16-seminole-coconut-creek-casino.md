This project was a fast track project (9 months) to completely renovate the existing casino as well adding new casino space and new restaurants.

Champion was charged with coordinating and maintaining all power and data to the existing Casino while moving all of the power to a new second floor electric room.

The new electric room also contained a new UPS System which covered all gaming circuits.

**Owner: Seminole Tribe of Florida**

**General Contractor: Moss Anderson JV**
