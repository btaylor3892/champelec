The Fresh Harvest Buffet in Hollywood, FL is located inside the newly renovated Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. The many food stations are well lit by both recessed and pendant lights. The ceilings above both the buffet and the dining areas have beautiful cove lighting and impressive chandeliers. The under counter lights surrounding the entire buffet add to the modern feel of the restaurant while lighting the ornamental shelves below. 

The fast track schedule for this job demanded detailed coordination with all trades to ensure an on time completion in just 4 and a half months.

**Owner: Seminole Tribe of Florida**
