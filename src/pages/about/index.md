### We Strive To Exceed Expectations & Make Friends Along The Way

In our commercial construction projects we seek work that will challenge us. We enjoy driving past the buildings we've worked on, knowing that we had a part in making that building exist in the way it does today. It's rewarding to tell and showing others what we've accomplished.

In our service work, both residential and commercial we strive to give our customers the best final product for a beyond reasonable price. We enjoy dealing with our repeat customers as we have gotten to know each other over the years. Everyday we work hard to try and gain more repeat customers, because that is a sign to us that we are doing things right.

We also, have many long term employees in our company who have given many hard worked hours not just during the weekdays, but also on weeknights, weekends and holidays to make all of this possible. We feel that we have a great working relationship with all of our employees and look forward to continue these relationships if not better them as well as create more with future employees. Check out our careers page, we always have at least a job opening or two up even when we aren't hiring because we can always find a role for a hard worker somewhere.

With only their experience and a little help from some friends, they started over from scratch in a much different South Florida market from what they were used to in New York. Rich drove the company's first truck which was given to them from a friend from New York to Florida with some tools in the back.

### Ten Years Have Passed

After ten years of business Champion has just finished up it's largest project so far, The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Remodel and Expansion. As one of the three Electrical Contractors on site we are proud to have worked on the remodel and expansion of the casino floor as well as the Hard Rock Cafe, Marketplace Buffet, Food Court, Comedy Club, Plum Lounge, High Limit Slots and a portion of the back of house area. The future looks bright for us all here at Champion if we continue to do work as has been done on this project.
