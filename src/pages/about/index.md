### We Strive To Exceed Expectations & Make Friends Along The Way

We seek work that will challenge us. 

We look to do work that inspires us to use our skills and experience to meet and exceed our customers expectations.  

We strive to bring additional value to our clients to ensure that we are part of their team not just for the present project but any future work.

In our commercial construction projects, we enjoy driving past the buildings we've worked on, knowing that we had a part in making that building exist in the way it does today. 

It's rewarding to tell and show others what we've accomplished. 

On all projects we take pride in our work and as can be seen in the image above make even the places that are never seen look appealing and well installed.

In our service work, both residential and commercial we strive to give our customers the best final product for a beyond reasonable price. We enjoy dealing with our repeat customers as we have gotten to know each other over the years. Everyday we work hard to try and gain more repeat customers, because that is a sign to us that we are doing things right.

We also, have many long term employees in our company who have given many hard worked hours not just during the weekdays, but also on weeknights, weekends and holidays to make all of this possible. We feel that we have a great working relationship with all of our employees and look forward to continue these relationships if not better them as well as create more with future employees. Check out our careers page, we always have at least a job opening or two up even when we aren't hiring because we can always find a role for a hard worker somewhere.

### It All Started in 2009

Champion Electrical Contracting, LLC was founded in 2009 by Rich and Carolyn Taylor. Rich had been a Local 3 Electrical Contractor in New York City for over a decade, before they decided to move their family down to Florida. Carolyn worked for many years in the office of her father's company, who was also a Local 3 Electrical Contractor. With only their experience and a little help from some friends, they started over from scratch in a much different South Florida market. 

### The Early Days

The company's first project was installing a light fixture for the Gallerit 

### Growing Through The Years

We continued to increase our business by adding a commercial and residential service division. We have added a second location in Davie, Florida.

### Ten Years Have Passed

After ten years of business Champion has just finished up it's largest project so far, The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Remodel and Expansion. As one of the three Electrical Contractors on site we are proud to have worked on the remodel and expansion of the casino floor as well as the Hard Rock Cafe, Marketplace Buffet, Food Court, Comedy Club, Plum Lounge, High Limit Slots and a portion of the back of house area. The future looks bright for us all here at Champion if we continue to do work as has been done on this project.

### The Next Ten Years
