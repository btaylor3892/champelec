### We Strive To Exceed Expectations
We seek work that will challenge us.

### It All Started in 2009
Champion Electrical Contracting, LLC was founded in 2009 by Rich and Carolyn Taylor. Rich had been a Local 3 Electrical Contractor in New York City for over a decade, before they decided to move their family down to Florida. Carolyn worked for many years in the office of her father's company, who was also a Local 3 Electrical Contractor. With only their experience and a little help from some friends, they started over from scratch in a much different South Florida market from what they were used to in New York. Rich drove the company's first truck which was given to them from a friend from New York to Florida with some tools in the back.

### The Early Days
The company's first project was installing a light fixture for the Gallerit 

### Growing Through The Years
We continued to increase our business by adding a commercial and residential service division. We have added a second location in Davie, Florida.

### Ten Years Have Passed
After ten years of business Champion has just finished up it's largest project so far, The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Remodel and Expansion. As one of the three Electrical Contractors on site we are proud to have worked on the remodel and expansion of the casino floor as well as the Hard Rock Cafe, Marketplace Buffet, Food Court, Comedy Club, Plum Lounge, High Limit Slots and a portion of the back of house area. The future looks bright for us all here at Champion if we continue to do work as has been done on this project.
